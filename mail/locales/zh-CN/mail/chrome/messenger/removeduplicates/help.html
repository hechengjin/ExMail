<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
<i>Rightclick on a folder</i> you want to search for duplicate messages. In
the folder context menu choose <i>Remove Duplicate Messages</i>. Now
information about the e-mails in the folders are being collected. The
algorithm has a linear complexity! This means, it needs for the tenth amount of
messages about ten times as long. In contrary, most compare algorithms have
quadratic complexity and need for the tenth amount about onehundred times as
long.<br>
After the search all duplicate messages are shown in a list. All exemplars
of a duplicate messare are shown. The first one is marked with "KEEP" by
default while all other copies are marked with DEL (delete). When you close the
dialog now by clicking on Ok from each duplicate one will be kept and all
copies are moved to the trashcan.<br>
If you <i>double click (or middle click)</i> on a message the status flas is changed from
"KEEP" to "DEL" or "DEL" to "KEEP". With a <i>leftclick</i> the message is
shown in the main window and the folder of the message is chosen in the
folder view. A <i>rightclick</i> on a message gives you additional
information about a message. When <i>clicking on Ok</i> all messages in the
list marked with "DEL" will be moved to the trashcan.

<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>
<u>compare Message ID:</u> The message ID is intended to be a unique number,
but tests have shown that this does not hold true in all cases. Sometimes
messages have the same message ID or no message ID at all. This happens for
example when you import messages from other mail cliens. So you should not
rely on the message ID.
<br>

<u>Compare date in seconds:</u> Depending on the number of messages you
receive, this compare criterium is almost unique. Exceptions are wrong
configured sender that claim to send the message on 1/1/1970 or sender that
do not include a date at all.
<br>

<u>Compare subject:</u> A subject compare is very seldom unique, because
most of the time subjects are similar to "Newsletter from ..." or "Hi". So
you should always use this setting with others together.
<br>

<u>Compare sender:</u> 
See subject.
<br>

<u>Compare line count:</u> 
All other compare methods just compared the message by its headers. But this
one compares the message bodies with each other. To be precise, it only
compares the number of lines and this is not very reliable. For example,
when you imported messages from different mail client, they might have a
diferent line count, because every mail client stores different information
in the header. So it could happen that identical messages seems to be
differen.
<br>

<u>Compare message body (slow):</u> 
Compares the content of the messages. This option is significantly slower
than all others, but since it is implemented with fast algorithms, it is
still fast.
<br>

<u>Search in subfolder first:</u> 
If this option is on subfolders are searched first for messages. After
searching subfolders, the folder content is searched. With this option you
decide, which duplicate message you want to remove. If search in subfolder
first is on, the duplicate message in the subfolder will be removed th eone
in the parent folder ist being kept. If you want to keep the message in the
subfolder and prefere to delete the one in the parent folder turn this
option off (default).
<br>

<u>Ignore trashcan for the message search:</u> 
If you have removed duplicate messages, these were moved to the trashcan.
Now, if you start a new search without emtying the trashcan, the duplicate
messages are still there an the algorithm will find again duplicate
messages. Depending on the search order the messages in the trashcan will be
deleted again (nothing happens) or the duplicates not being in the trashcan
will be moved into the trashcan. So all messages are now in the trashcan.
Since this is not what is usually intended, you can turn searching the
trashcan off (default).
<br>


<u>Print debug info:</u> 
Only use this option when searching few messages.
