<h4>Mode</h4>
<ul>
    <li>"1" : the list contains 1 part :
        <ul>
            <li>'contains' : contacts &amp; lists whose fields contains X</li>
        </ul>
        With "mode" "1", it's better to set "Nb line max in each part" to 15-30.
    </li>
    <li>"2" : the list contains 3 parts :
        <ul>
            <li>'begin' :    contacts whose fields begin with X</li>
            <li>'contains' : contacts whose fields contains X (except those in part 1)</li>
            <li>'list' :     groups whose fields contains X</li>
        </ul>
        With mode "2", it's better to set "Nb line max in each part" to 5-10.<br/>
    </li>
    <li>"3" : the list contains 1 part for each AddressBook :
        <ul>
            <li>contacts &amp; lists whose fields contains X</li>
        </ul>
        With mode "3", it's better to set "Nb line max in each part" to 5-10.<br/>
    </li>
</ul>
Searched fields are :
<ul>
<li>'PrimaryEmail', 'FirstName', 'LastName', 'NickName' for contacts</li>
<li>fields is 'LastName' for list</li>
</ul>
On slow machines, it's better to choose "1".
