/**
 * Tests importing an address book export in the LDAP data interchange (LDIF)
 * format and checks the accuracy of the imported address book's cards.
 * The current export contains only one card with most fields full.
 *
 * This test also checks for the following bugs:
 *   -Bug 439819: LDIF import does not include mozillahomestreet.
 *   -Bug 182128: Edit Card, Notes on several lines appear on one after
 *                export/import in text format *(only tests the import).
