/* This file provides the ability to save up the entire contents of a MIME
   object (of arbitrary size), and then emit it all at once later.  The
   buffering is done in an efficient way that works well for both very large
   and very small objects.

   This is used in two places:

   = The implementation of multipart/alternative uses this code to do a
     one-part-lookahead.  As it traverses its children, it moves forward
     until it finds a part which cannot be displayed; and then it displays
     the *previous* part (the last which *could* be displayed.)  This code
     is used to hold the previous part until it is needed.
