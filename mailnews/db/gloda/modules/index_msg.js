/**
 * The message indexer!
 *
 * === Message Indexing Strategy
 * To these ends, we implement things like so:
 *
 * Mesage State Tracking
 * - We store a property on all indexed headers indicating their gloda message
 *   id.  This allows us to tell whether a message is indexed from the header,
 *   without having to consult the SQL database.
 * - When we receive an event that indicates that a message's meta-data has
 *   changed and gloda needs to re-index the message, we set a property on the
 *   header that indicates the message is dirty.  This property can indicate
 *   that the message needs to be re-indexed but the gloda-id is valid (dirty)
 *   or that the message's gloda-id is invalid (filthy) because the gloda
 *   database has been blown away.
 * - We track whether a folder is up-to-date on our GlodaFolder representation
 *   using a concept of dirtiness, just like messages.  Like messages, a folder
 *   can be dirty or filthy.  A dirty folder has at least one dirty message in
 *   it which means we should scan the folder.  A filthy folder means that
 *   every message in the folder should be considered filthy.  Folders start
 *   out filthy when Gloda is first told about them indicating we cannot
 *   trust any of the gloda-id's in the folders.  Filthy folders are downgraded
 *   to dirty folders after we mark all of the headers with gloda-id's filthy.
 *
 * Indexing Message Control
 * - We index the headers of all IMAP messages. We index the bodies of all IMAP
 *   messages that are offline.  We index all local messages.  We plan to avoid
 *   indexing news messages.
 * - We would like a way to express desires about indexing that either don't
 *   confound offline storage with indexing, or actually allow some choice.
 *
 * Indexing Messages
 * - We have two major modes of indexing: sweep and event-driven.  When we
 *   start up we kick off an indexing sweep.  We use event-driven indexing
 *   as we receive events for eligible messages, but if we get too many
 *   events we start dropping them on the floor and just flag that an indexing
 *   sweep is required.
 * - The sweep initiates folder indexing jobs based on the priorities assigned
 *   to folders.  Folder indexing uses a filtered message enumerator to find
 *   messages that need to be indexed, minimizing wasteful exposure of message
 *   headers to XPConnect that we would not end up indexing.
 * - For local folders, we use GetDatabaseWithReparse to ensure that the .msf
 *   file exists.  For IMAP folders, we simply use GetDatabase because we know
 *   the auto-sync logic will make sure that the folder is up-to-date and we
 *   want to avoid creating problems through use of updateFolder.
 *
 * Junk Mail
 * - We do not index junk.  We do not index messages until the junk/non-junk
 *   determination has been made.  If a message gets marked as junk, we act like
 *   it was deleted.
 * - We know when a message is actively queued for junk processing thanks to
 *   folder processing flags.  nsMsgDBFolder::CallFilterPlugins does this
 *   prior to initiating spam processing.  Unfortunately, this method does not
 *   get called until after we receive the notification about the existence of
 *   the header.  How long after can vary on different factors.  The longest
 *   delay is in the IMAP case where there is a filter that requires the
 *   message body to be present; the method does not get called until all the
 *   bodies are downloaded.
 *

   * We end up processing two streams of gloda-id's and some extra info.  In
   *  the normal case we expect these two streams to line up exactly and all
   *  we need to do is update the message key if it has changed.
   *
   * There are a few exceptional cases where things do not line up:
   * 1) The gloda database knows about a message that the enumerator does not
   *    know about...
   *   a) This message exists in the folder (identified using its message-id
   *      header).  This means the message got indexed but PendingCommitTracker
   *      had to forget about the info when the compaction happened.  We
   *      re-establish the link and track the message in PendingCommitTracker
   *      again.
   *   b) The message does not exist in the folder.  This means the message got
   *      indexed, PendingCommitTracker had to forget about the info, and
   *      then the message either got moved or deleted before now.  We mark
   *      the message as deleted; this allows the gloda message to be reused
   *      if the move target has not yet been indexed or purged if it already
   *      has been and the gloda message is a duplicate.  And obviously, if the
   *      event that happened was actually a delete, then the delete is the
   *      right thing to do.
   * 2) The enumerator knows about a message that the gloda database does not
   *    know about.  This is unexpected and should not happen.  We log a
   *    warning.  We are able to differentiate this case from case #1a by
   *    retrieving the message header associated with the next gloda message
   *    (using the message-id header per 1a again).  If the gloda message's
   *    message key is after the enumerator's message key then we know this is
   *    case #2.  (It implies an insertion in the enumerator stream which is how
   *    we define the unexpected case.)
   *
   * Besides updating the database rows, we also need to make sure that
   *  in-memory representations are updated.  Immediately after dispatching
   *  UPDATE changes to the database we use the same set of data to walk the
   *  live collections and update any affected messages.  We are then able to
   *  discard the information.  Although this means that we will have to
   *  potentially walk the live collections multiple times, unless something
   *  has gone horribly wrong, the number of collections should be reasonable
   *  and the lookups are cheap.  We bias batch sizes accordingly.
   *
   * Because we operate based on chunks we need to make sure that when we
   *  actually deal with multiple chunks that we don't step on our own feet with
   *  our database updates.  Since compaction of message key K results in a new
   *  message key K' such that K' <= K, we can reliably issue database
   *  updates for all values <= K.  Which means our feet are safe no matter
   *  when we issue the update command.  For maximum cache benefit, we issue
   *  our updates prior to our new query since they should still be maximally
   *  hot at that point.

     *  headers is that allowUndo was true when the operation was performance.
     *  The only non-obvious thing is that we need to make sure that we deal
     *  with the impact of filthy folders and messages on gloda-id's (they
     *  invalidate the gloda-id).
     *
     * Moves to an IMAP folder that do not generate offline fake headers do not
     *  provide us with the target header, but the IMAP SetPendingAttributes
     *  logic will still attempt to propagate the properties on the message
     *  header so when we eventually see it in the msgsClassified notification,
     *  it should have the properties of the source message copied over.
     * We make sure that gloda-id's do not get propagated when messages are
     *  moved from IMAP folders that are marked filthy or are marked as not
     *  supposed to be indexed by clearing the pending attributes for the header
     *  being tracked by the destination IMAP folder.
     * We could fast-path the IMAP move case in msgsClassified by noticing that
     *  a message is showing up with a gloda-id header already and just
     *  performing an async location update.
     *
     * Moves that occur involving 'compacted' folders are fine and do not
     *  require special handling here.  The one tricky super-edge-case that
     *  can happen (and gets handled by the compaction pass) is the move of a
     *  message that got gloda indexed that did not already have a gloda-id and
     *  PendingCommitTracker did not get to flush the gloda-id before the
     *  compaction happened.  In that case our move logic cannot know to do
     *  anything and the gloda database still thinks the message lives in our
     *  folder.  The compaction pass will deal with this by marking the message
     *  as deleted.  The rationale being that marking it deleted allows the
     *  message to be re-used if it gets indexed in the target location, or if
     *  the target location has already been indexed, we no longer need the
     *  duplicate and it should be deleted.  (Also, it is unable to distinguish
     *  between a case where the message got deleted versus moved.)
     *
     * Because copied messages are, by their nature, duplicate messages, we
     *  do not particularly care about them.  As such, we defer their processing
     *  to the automatic sync logic that will happen much later on.  This is
     *  potentially desirable in case the user deletes some of the original
     *  messages, allowing us to reuse the gloda message representations when
     *  we finally get around to indexing the messages.  We do need to mark the
     *  folder as dirty, though, to clue in the sync logic.
