/**
 * Provides the user-visible (and extension visible) global database
 *  functionality.  There is currently a dependency/ordering
 *  problem in that the concept of 'gloda' also includes some logic that is
 *  contributed by built-in extensions, if you will.  Those built-in extensions
 *  (fundattr.js, explattr.js) also import this file.  To avoid a circular
 *  dependency, those built-in extensions are loaded by everybody.js.  The
 *  simplest/best solution is probably to move everybody.js to be gloda.js and
 *  have it re-export only 'Gloda'.  gloda.js (this file) can then move to be
 *  gloda_int.js (or whatever our eventual naming scheme is), which built-in
 *  extensions can explicitly rely upon.
 *
 * === Concepts
 *
 * == Nouns
 *
 * Inspired by reasonable uses of triple-stores, I have tried to leverage
 *  existing model and terminology rather than rolling out own for everything.
 *  The idea with triple-stores is that you have a subject, a predicate, and an
 *  object.  For example, if we are talking about a message, that is the
 *  subject, the predicate could roughly be sent-by, and the object a person.
 *  We can generalize this idea to say that the subject and objects are nouns.
 * Since we want to be more flexible than only dealing with messages, we
 *  therefore introduce the concept of nouns as an organizing principle.
 *
 * == Attributes
 *
 * Our attributes definitions are basically our predicates.  When we define
 *  an attribute, it's a label with a bunch of meta-data.  Our attribute
 *  instances are basically a 'triple' in a triple-store.  The attributes
 *  are stored in database rows that imply a specific noun-type (ex: the
 *  messageAttributes table), with an ID identifying the message which is our
 *  subject, an attribute ID which identifies the attribute definition in use
 *  (and therefore the predicate), plus an object ID (given context aka the
 *  noun type by the attribute's meta-data) which identifies the 'object'.
 *
 * == But...
 *
 * Things aren't entirely as clear as they could be right now, terminology/
 *  concept/implementation-wise.  Some work is probably still in order.
 *
 * === Implementation
 *
 * == Nouns
 *
 * So, we go and define the nouns that are roughly the classes in our data
 *  model.  Every 'class' we define in datamodel.js is a noun that gets defined
 *  here in the Gloda core.  We provide sufficient meta-data about the noun to
 *  serialize/deserialize its representation from our database representation.
 *  Nouns do not have to be defined in this class, but can also be contributed
 *  by external code.
 * We have a concept of 'first class' nouns versus non-first class nouns.  The
 *  distinction is meant to be whether we can store meta-information about those
 *  nouns using attributes.  Right now, only message are real first-class nouns,
 *  but we want to expand that to include contacts and eventually events and
 *  tasks as lightning-integration occurs.  In practice, we are stretching the
 *  definition of first-class nouns slightly to include things we can't store
 *  meta-data about, but want to be able to query about.  We do want to resolve
 *  this.
 *
 * == Attributes
 *
 * Attributes are defined by "attribute providers" who are responsible for
 *  taking an instance of a first-class noun (for which they are registered)
 *  plus perhaps some other meta-data, and returning a list of attributes
 *  extracted from that noun.  For now, this means messages.  Attribute
 *  providers may create new data records as a side-effect of the indexing
 *  process, although we have not yet fully dealt with the problem of deleting
 *  these records should they become orphaned in the database due to the
 *  purging of a message and its attributes.
 * All of the 'core' gloda attributes are provided by the fundattr.js and
 *  explattr.js providers.
 *
 * === (Notable) Future Work
 *
 * == Attributes
 *
 * Attribute mechanisms currently lack any support for 'overriding' attributes
 *  provided by other attribute providers.  For example, the fundattr provider
 *  tells us who a message is 'from' based on the e-mail address present.
 *  However, other plugins may actually know better.  For example, the bugzilla
 *  daemon e-mails based on bug activity although the daemon gets the credit
 *  as the official sender.  A bugzilla plugin can easily extract the actual
 *  person/e-mail addressed who did something on the bug to cause the
 *  notification to be sent.  In practice, we would like that person to be
 *  the 'sender' of the bugmail.  But we can't really do that right, yet.

   *     the canonical name for debugging purposes and for people to pass to
   *     lookupNoun.  The suggested convention is lower-case-dash-delimited,
   *     with names being singular (since it's a single noun we are referring
   *     to.)
   * @param aNounDef.class The 'class' to which an instance of the noun will
   *     belong (aka will pass an instanceof test).  You may also provide this
   *     as 'clazz' if the keyword makes your IDE angry.
   * @param aNounDef.allowsArbitraryAttrs Is this a 'first class noun'/can it be
   *     a subject, AKA can this noun have attributes stored on it that relate
   *     it to other things?  For example, a message is first-class; we store
   *     attributes of messages.  A date is not first-class now, nor is it
   *     likely to be; we will not store attributes about a date, although dates
   *     will be the objects of other subjects.  (For example: we might
   *     associate a date with a calendar event, but the date is an attribute of
   *     the calendar event and not vice versa.)
   * @param aNounDef.usesParameter A boolean indicating whether this noun
   *     requires use of the 'parameter' BLOB storage field on the attribute
   *     bindings in the database to persist itself.  Use of parameters should
   *     be limited to a reasonable number of values (16-32 is okay, more than
   *     that is pushing it and 256 should be considered an absolute upper
   *     bound) because of the database organization.  When false, your
   *     toParamAndValue function is expected to return null for the parameter
   *     and likewise your fromParamAndValue should expect ignore and generally
   *     ignore the argument.
   * @param aNounDef.toParamAndValue A function that takes an instantiated noun
   *     instance and returns a 2-element list of [parameter, value] where
   *     parameter may only be non-null if you passed a usesParameter of true.
   *     Parameter may be of any type (BLOB), and value must be numeric (pass
   *     0 if you don't need the value).
   *
   * @param aNounDef.isPrimitive True when the noun instance is a raw numeric
   *     value/string/boolean.  False when the instance is an object.  When
   *     false, it is assumed the attribute that serves as a unique identifier
   *     for the value is "id" unless 'idAttr' is provided.
   * @param [aNounDef.idAttr="id"] For non-primitive nouns, this is the
   *     attribute on the object that uniquely identifies it.
   *
   * @param aNounDef.schema Unsupported mechanism by which you can define a
   *     table that corresponds to this noun.  The table will be created if it
   *     does not exist.
   *     - name The table name; don't conflict with other things!
   *     - columns A list of [column name, sqlite type] tuples.  You should
   *       always include a definition like ["id", "INTEGER PRIMARY KEY"] for
   *       now (and it should be the first column name too.)  If you care about
   *       how the attributes are poked into your object (for example, you want
   *       underscores used for some of them because the attributes should be
   *       immutable), then you can include a third string that is the name of
   *       the attribute to use.
   *     - indices A dictionary of lists of column names, where the key name
   *       becomes the index name.  Ex: {foo: ["bar"]} results in an index on
   *       the column "bar" where the index is named "foo".

   * - shortName: The name that should be used to display this constraint.  For

   *   using shortName as the label.

   * @param aAttrDef.provider The object instance providing a 'process' method.
   * @param aAttrDef.extensionName The name of the extension providing these
   *     attributes.
   * @param aAttrDef.attributeType The type of attribute, one of the values from
   *     the kAttr* enumeration.
   * @param aAttrDef.attributeName The name of the attribute, which also doubles
   *     as the bound property name if you pass 'bind' a value of true.  You are
   *     responsible for avoiding collisions, which presumably will mean
   *     checking/updating a wiki page in the future, or just prefixing your
   *     attribute name with your extension name or something like that.
   * @param aAttrDef.bind Should this attribute be 'bound' as a convenience
   *     attribute on the subject's object (true/false)?  For example, with an
   *     attributeName of "foo" and passing true for 'bind' with a subject noun
   *     of NOUN_MESSAGE, GlodaMessage instances will expose a "foo" getter that
   *     returns the value of the attribute.  If 'singular' is true, this means
   *     an instance of the object class corresponding to the noun type or null
   *     if the attribute does not exist.  If 'singular' is false, this means a
   *     list of instances of the object class corresponding to the noun type,
   *     where the list may be empty if no instances of the attribute are
   *     present.
   * @param aAttrDef.bindName Optional override of attributeName for purposes of
   *     the binding property's name.
   * @param aAttrDef.singular Is the attribute going to happen at most once
   *     (true), or potentially multiple times (false).  This affects whether
   *     the binding returns a list or just a single item (which is null when
   *     the attribute is not present).
   * @param [aAttrDef.emptySetIsSignificant=false] Should we
   * @param aAttrDef.subjectNouns A list of object types (NOUNs) that this
   *     attribute can be set on.  Each element in the list should be one of the
   *     NOUN_* constants or a dynamically registered noun type.
   * @param aAttrDef.objectNoun The object type (one of the NOUN_* constants or
   *     a dynamically registered noun types) that is the 'object' in the
   *     traditional RDF triple.  More pragmatically, in the database row used
   *     to represent an attribute, we store the subject (ex: message ID),

  /**
   * Create a new query instance for the given noun-type.  This provides
   *  a generic way to provide constraint-based queries of any first-class
   *  nouns supported by the system.
   *
   * The idea is that every attribute on an object can be used to express
   *  a constraint on the query object.  Constraints implicitly 'AND' together,
   *  but providing multiple arguments to a constraint function results in an
   *  'OR'ing of those values.  Additionally, you can call or() on the returned
   *  query to create an alternate query that is effectively a giant OR against
   *  all the constraints you create on the main query object (or any other
   *  alternate queries returned by or()).  (Note: there is no nesting of these
   *  alternate queries. query.or().or() is equivalent to query.or())
   * For each attribute, there is a constraint with the same name that takes
   *  one or more arguments.  The arguments represent a set of OR values that
   *  objects matching the query can have.  (If you want the constraint
   *  effectively ANDed together, just invoke the constraint function
   *  multiple times.)  For example, newQuery(NOUN_PERSON).age(25) would
   *  constraint to all the people aged 25, while age(25, 26) would constrain
   *  to all the people age 25 or 26.
   * For each attribute with a 'continuous' noun, there is a constraint with the
   *  attribute name with "Range" appended.  It takes two arguments which are an
   *  inclusive lower bound and an inclusive lower bound for values in the
   *  range.  If you would like an open-ended range on either side, pass null
   *  for that argument.  If you would like to specify multiple ranges that
   *  should be ORed together, simply pass additional (pairs of) arguments.
   *  For example, newQuery(NOUN_PERSON).age(25,100) would constraint to all
   *  the people who are >= 25 and <= 100.  Likewise age(25, null) would just
   *  return all the people who are 25 or older.  And age(25,30,35,40) would
   *  return people who are either 25-30 or 35-30.
   * There are also full-text constraint columns.  In a nutshell, their
   *  arguments are the strings that should be passed to the SQLite FTS3
   *  MATCH clause.
