/**
 * An interface representing an address book card.
 *
 * The UUID of a card is a composition of a directory ID and a per-directory ID.
 * The per-directory ID is reflected in the localId property. If either of these
 * properties change, the UUID will change correspondingly.
 *
 * None of these IDs will be reflected in the property collection. Neither
 * nsIAbCard::properties, nsIAbCard::deleteProperty, nor any of the property
 * getters and setters are able to interact with these properties.
 *
 * Fundamentally, a card is a collection of properties. Modifying a property in
 * some way on a card does not change the backend used to store the card; the
 * directory is required to do make the changes here.
 *
 * The following are the core properties that are used:
 * - Names:
 *   - FirstName, LastName
 *   - PhoneticFirstName, PhoneticLastName
 *   - DisplayName, NickName
 *   - SpouseName, FamilyName
 * - PrimaryEmail, SecondEmail
 * - Home Contact:
 *   - HomeAddress, HomeAddress2, HomeCity, HomeState, HomeZipCode, HomeCountry
 *   - HomePhone, HomePhoneType
 * - Work contact. Same as home, but with `Work' instead of `Home'
 * - Other Contact:
 *   - FaxNumber, FaxNumberType
 *   - PagerNumber, PagerNumberType
 *   - CellularNumber, CellularNumberType
 * - JobTitle, Department, Company
 * - _AimScreenName
 * - Dates:
 *   - AnniversaryYear, AnniversaryMonth, AnniversaryDay
 *   - BirthYear, BirthMonth, BirthDay
 * - WebPage1 (work), WebPage2 (home)
 * - Custom1, Custom2, Custom3, Custom4
 * - Notes
 * - Integral properties:
 *   - LastModifiedDate
 *   - PopularityIndex
 *   - PreferMailFormat (see nsIAbPreferMailFormat)
 * - Boolean properties:
 *   - AllowRemoteContent
 * - Photo properties:
 *   - PhotoName
 *   - PhotoType
 *   - PhotoURI
 *
 * The contract id for the standard implementation is
 * <tt>\@mozilla.org/addressbook/cardproperty;1</tt>.
