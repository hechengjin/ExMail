jaas.jar
    required for SASL code compilation

jnet.jar and jsse.jar
    required for JSSESocketFactory.java compilation

jss32_stub.jar
    required for JSSSocketFactory.java compilation

    jss32_stub.jar is created from the mozilla JSS 3.2 jss32.jar
    (see http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/jss/jss_release_3.2.html)
    by extracting only the classes used for JSSSocketFactory.java compilation.
    At runtime you must have jss32.jar if you intend to use JSSSocketFactory.
