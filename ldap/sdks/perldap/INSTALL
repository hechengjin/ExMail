PerLDAP installation instructions
==================================

Building this package is fairly straight forward, but requires some
knowledge about using compilers and compiler tools on your system. If you
are uncomfortable using these tools, we recommend you get one of the
prebuilt binary distributions instead.


Prerequisites
=============

In order to build the module, you'll need

	- Perl, version 5.003 or later. We definitely recommend you to use
          v5.004 or later.

	- An ANSI-C compiler, e.g. gcc-2.x, or Visual C++ 5.0.

	- The LDAP client libraries and include files, e.g. the SDK from
	Netscape Communications. See the README file for information on
	retrieving binaries.

You can download (or CVS checkout) the Directory SDK source, see further
information available on

	http://www.mozilla.org/directory/

and the FAQ at

	http://www.mozilla.org/directory/faq/perldap-faq.html



Building
========

This package uses the normal Perl5 MakeMaker installation system. To
generate a Makefile appropriate for your platform, run perl on the
provided Makefile.PL script, e.g.

	% perl Makefile.PL


You might have to use the command `perl5' or `perl-5.004', depending on
how you installed Perl-5. The script will now ask you a few questions to
find the necessary library and include files. A typical configuration
session is

    data 195% perl5 Makefile.PL

    PerLDAP - Perl 5 Module for LDAP
    ================================
    Directory containing 'include' and 'lib' directory of the Netscape
    LDAP Software Developer Kit (default: /usr): /opt/ldapsdk3
    Using LDAPv3 Developer Kit (default: yes)?  
    Include SSL Support (default: yes)?  
    Libraries to link with (default: -L/opt/pkg/ldapsdk3/lib -lldapssl30):  
    Checking if your kit is complete...
    Looks good
    Writing Makefile for Mozilla::LDAP::API



The important question is where your LDAP SDK is installed, in the example
above the base directory is /opt/ldapsdk3. This directory should have two
subdirectories, named "lib" and "include". If you installed the SDK in the
standard /usr hierarchy, use the default value as provided by the install
script.

Assuming you get no errors or warning, proceed with the build and install:

	% make
	% make install


That should be it!


Automated Configuration and Installs
====================================

The Makefile.PL script also honors a set of environment variables to make
it possible to do configuration and installs non-interactively. The
variables are

        LDAPSDKDIR    - Full path to the C SDK base directory
        LDAPV3ON      - Set to "N" to diable LDAP v3 (on by default)
        LDAPSDKSSL    - Set to "N" to disable SSL (SSL is default)


With these variables set, you will not be asked any of the questions above
(but it will echo the paramaters). Just run the Makefile.PL script, and
finish the build, e.g.

        % perl5 Makefile.PL
	% make
	% make install
