# cvsdl: perform a 'cvs diff' to examine the last change made to a file on the
#	current branch.
#
# usage: cvsdl [-n] [-v] [-revs] [cvs-diff-options] [files...]
#   where:
#      "revs" is a number that indicates how many revisions to go back
#              when diffing (default is 1)
# and  "-n"   shows the cvs diff command that would be executed without
#              actually executing it.
# and  "-v"   enables verbose output.
#
#   e.g., cvsdl -c mozilla/directory/c-sdk/ldap/Makefile
#   e.g., cvsdl -n mozilla/directory/c-sdk/ldap/Makefile
#   e.g., cvsdl -3 mozilla/directory/c-sdk/ldap/Makefile
#
# if no files are listed, all in the current directory are diff'd.
# cvs-diff-options can also be passed in the CVSDLOPTIONS environment variable.
#
# Known Bug: the detection of "first revision on a branch" is broken.
