Summary of options used by the LDAP tools

Updated 1-April-2003 by Mark Smith <mcs@netscape.com>


Only single letter options in the sets [0-9], [A-Z], and [a-z] are
listed.

The "raw" lists are taken from the calls to getopt() and
ldaptool_process_args().

The "sorted" lists are just that -- sorted versions of the raw list.

The "all" lists include options from common.c as well as the tool-specific
options.

The "avail" lists included options that are available for use.
